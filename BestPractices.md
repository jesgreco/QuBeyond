# **What is the best practice in keeping product documentation updated with ongoing product changes?**

## **Overview**

This document is aimed at detailing which is the best practice in view of keeping product documentation updated for ongoing product changes.

## **Product documentation: Best practices**

Before explaining the best practice itself it is useful to define what is product documentation. This kind of documentation describes the product that is being developed and provides instructions on how to perform different tasks with it. As a technical writer, first of all, it is important to choose a software documentation tool to deliver such documentation to your users; that tool can be GitHub.

### Version control
As a product company, Qu Beyond is constantly releasing new features. As a consequence, there is a need to iterate on versions of the product or features, and it is highly essential to keep track of the different versions of the documentation. This can even mean creating entirely new knowledge bases and maintaining several knowledge bases for different versions of the product. For that reason, as a technical writer, you should use a tool which allows you allows you to create different versions of your documentation and even switch between them in the editor.  In addition, there may be a need to keep different versions of such documentation live at the same time for customers who are using different releases. 
Keeping track of your documentation tasks in collaboration tools like Jira or Trello is also essential. 

### Markup languages
Consider whether you want to work in a lightweight markup language. This can be especially useful if you’re working with Docs like Code, and you want to keep your content alongside the codebase. Tools like GitHub allow you to work in Markdown and generally it’s necessary for your technical writers to be able to use markup. 
One of the advantages of working in a lightweight markup language is that content can be easily styled and presented in a visually appealing way. 
Also, if you need to migrate your content over to a different system, if it’s written in markup then you can keep all the formatting in your content.

### Important key elements

**Use links and anchors**. They will help you make the document easier to read and search as readers will be able to comprehend the information gradually. For instance, you can provide links to customer interviews and anchors to previous discussions or other external information related to the project.
**Use diagramming tools** to better communicate the problems to your team. People are more likely to perceive information by looking at the images than reading an extensive document. Different visual models will help you to perform this task and outline requirements more effectively.

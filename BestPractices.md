# **Best practice to keep product documentation updated**

## **Overview**
This document is aimed at detailing the best practice in view of keeping product documentation updated with ongoing product changes.

## **Product documentation: Best practice**
Before explaining the best practice itself, it is useful to define what is product documentation. This kind of documentation describes the product that is being developed and provides instructions on how to perform different tasks with it. As a technical writer, first of all, it is important to choose a **software documentation tool** to deliver such documentation to your users; that tool can be **GitHub**.

### Version control
As a product company, Qu Beyond is constantly releasing new features. Consequently, there is a need to iterate on versions of the product or features, and it is highly essential to keep track of the different versions regarding the documentation. This can even mean creating entirely new knowledge bases and maintaining several knowledge bases for different versions of the product. For that reason, as a technical writer, you should **use a tool which allows you to create different versions of your documentation and even switch between them in the editor, like Helpjuice, Salesforce Service Cloud, or Azure DevOps (board). Keeping track of your documentation tasks in collaboration tools like Jira or Trello is also essential.** 

### Markup languages
Tools like GitHub allow you to work in Markdown and generally, it is necessary for technical writers to be able to use markup, like **Markdown**. One of the advantages of working in a **lightweight markup language** is that content can be easily styled and presented in a visually appealing way. Besides, if you need to migrate your content over to a different system (already written in markup), then you can keep all the formatting in your content.

### Important key elements
- **Using links and anchors**. This will contribute to make the document easier to read and search as readers will be able to understand the information gradually. For instance, you can provide links to customer interviews and anchors to previous discussions or other external information related to the project.
- **Including images**. People are more likely to perceive information by looking at the images than reading an extensive document. Different visual models will help readers to easily understand and get the main idea of the document in a more effective way than reading lot of paragraphs.
